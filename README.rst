New Project: Arcfire
====================

Just getting started.

*Arcfire* is the working title for a new project of mine; kind of a world builder for creating nonlinear narrative, paired with a particular setting and cast of characters.

The setting will (probably) be in the Arctic, sometime around 50K years in the future, when the ice caps have melted and humanity has dwindled.  Kevin Costner will not be involved.

I look forward to hammering out further details.  Stay tuned!


About the title
---

*Arcfire* doesn't mean much, really; It's a mashup between the Arctic, the setting of this tale, and the presumed heat of a postapocalyptic climate.  I chose it quickly because I needed a working title, it's easy to type, and I didn't want to spend much time on it.  

So don't take the title too seriously.  A working title, a code name, which I plan to change sometime in the future.


Eventual deliverables
---

* An API
* An HTML site
* A printed copy to take to the beach
* Lots of appendices, lateral narratives, maps, and other graphics.


Technical stack
---

I'm planning to build the bulk of this with Python, Django, and HTML5.  Eventually, when the API is settled, I may do something different on the front end: consume the beautiful Python with a JS framework, for example.  I'd like to stay with Python for as long as possible, though, to benefit from its classical structure.


Docs
---

I just created some Sphinx docs for the first time.  I will expand as I learn more about this project, and as I write code.

The tutorial to setup Sphinx is here:
